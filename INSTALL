INSTALLING dgnu-utils

You actually really don't want to install these in a common system-wide 
binary directory. You will almost certainly clobber the good gnu stuff 
with this junk. Therefore, there is no install target in the Makefile.

To build the tools, simply do a:

	make all

and all programs will be compiled and placed in a directory 'bin' in 
the dgnu-util source directory. You can also build each program 
individually. Just do a:

	make uname

or whatever, and so on. There are currently two other make targets.
You can 'make clean' to delete BINDIR and all programs inside it, and 
also do a 'make strip' to strip all the binaries of debugging symbols.

Please feel free to edit the Makefile to change the values you want 
passed to gcc (CFLAGS), and edit BINDIR to change the directory where 
the programs are installed.
