These are the ULL core utilities.

These programs are one man's silly attempt to rewrite the GNU coreutils,
for use as the userland for ULL (Userland Linux), a bastard hybrid of the
Linux kernel and a *BDSish userland.

Some of these programs are not portable away from the Linux OS.  As I find
the time I intend to make these programs run on Linux, OS X, *BSD, and
Solaris.  I can not realistically deliver a time frame for this.  Again, this
portability is to be an educational exercise for me.

See the file TODO for more details on programs I intend to write, and status
of 'in progress' programs, as well as notes on portability.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

As it stands, these programs are different from the GNU versions in several
fundamental ways.  First of all, it is not the first, nor even an important
goal for these programs to be 'drop-in' replacements.  Therefore, not all
functionality or command-line options/arguments are interfaced identically.
For example, I have tried to make the ULL utils have a consistant interface,
so I have adhered to standards such as '-h' and '--help' _always_ display
a usage/option summary, and '-V' and '--version' _always_ display version
information.  At times this convention clashes with the GNU version options.

For some of these programs, I do not intend to mimic all functionality of the
GNU versions for reasons of either personal interest, and/or technical ability.
Do not assume that because the GNU version does something, the ULL version
does as well.
