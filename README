These are the DGNU core utilities.

These programs are one man's silly attempt to rewrite the GNU coreutils,
and a few other common/useful applications from scratch in an effort to
both learn to program C better, and to learn the UNIX programming
environment better.

Some of these programs are not portable away from the Linux OS.  As I find
the time I intend to make these programs run on Linux, OS X, *BSD, and
Solaris.  I can not realistically deliver a time frame for this.  Again, this
portability is to be an educational exercise for me.

Here is a list of programs considered 'done':

    basename cat cd false free mkdir mv printenv pwd rm true uname uptime wc 
    whoami yes

Here is a list of programs in progress, in various states of usefulness:

    env sleep ln cp stat

See the file TODO for more details on programs I intend to write, and status
of 'in progress' programs, as well as notes on portability.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

As it stands, these programs are different from the GNU versions in several
fundamental ways.  First of all, it is not the first, nor even an important
goal for these programs to be 'drop-in' replacements.  Therefore, not all
functionality or command-line options/arguments are interfaced identically.
For example, I have tried to make the DGNU-Utils have a consistant interface,
so I have adhered to standards such as '-h' and '--help' _always_ display
a usage/option summary, and '-V' and '--version' _always_ display version
information.  At times this convention clashes with the GNU version options.

For some of these programs, I do not intend to mimic all functionality of the
GNU versions for reasons of either personal interest, and/or technical ability.
Do not assume that because the GNU version does something, the DGNU version
does as well.
