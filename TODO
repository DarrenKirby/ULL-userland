### Current status of programs

It looks like I'm picking this up again after nine years.
Now as then, this is just an exercise to teach myself C.

These programs are tested on three systems:
Gentoo Linux (GCC 14.3.0)
OS X Sonoma 14.7.1 (CLANG 16.0.0, GCC 15.1.0)
FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE (CLANG 14.1.7)

I'll putter around as I find time to do so. In the meantime,
I've decided to keep my original note from 2014 for historic
and sentimental reasons:

=======================================================================

Note: Just because the status is 'completed' doesn't mean I won't
still hack on it. Just means the core functionality that I intend
to implement is there. Over time I will add more error-checking or
refactoring, as well as adding portability fixes.

On portability: these programs are tested on three systems:
Gentoo Linux       (GCC 4.7.3, GLIBC 2.19)
OS X Mavericks     (LLVM 5.1, CLANG 503.0.40,)
FreeBSD 10-Release (CLANGBSD 3.3, )

...but developed on the linux machine for the most part. Am working
on portablility but a lot of the apps are flaky or don't even compile
on OS X and FreeBSD. See notes below...
