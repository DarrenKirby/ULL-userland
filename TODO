Current status of programs

Note: Just because the status is 'completed' doesn't mean I won't
still hack on it. Just means the core functionality that I intend
to implement is there. Over time I will add more error-checking or
refactoring, as well as adding portability fixes.

On portability: these programs are tested on three systems:
Gentoo Linux       (GCC 4.7.3, GLIBC 2.19)
OS X Mavericks     (LLVM 5.1, CLANG 503.0.40,)
FreeBSD 10-Release (CLANGBSD 3.3, )

...but developed on the linux machine for the most part. Am working
on portablility but a lot of the apps are flaky or don't even compile
on OS X and FeeBSD. See notes below...
